    <h1>I am writing my first HTML web page-- hell yeah!!!</h1>
      <p>I am writing my very first html file ever! I feel so SMRT!
        Just like Homer Simpson.
      </p>

      <p>Now I am going to try to <em>italisize</em> and
        use <b>bold</b>! Getting SMRTer every second!

        <b>SIDE NOTE:</b> EMAC's is making my life difficult. Why do I
        have to Meta Q every single TIME??? Why Peter?
